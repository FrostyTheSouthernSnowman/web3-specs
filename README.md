These specifications are intended to bring web3 to a new level. Ease of development and adoption are critical for improving web3. If web3 can attract businesses, they will improve web3.

# What Is Web3?
## Or What Should It Realistically Be?
Web3 is a new iteration of the internet built for scalable, secure, geographically distributed computing. With better mobile, edge, and IOT devices, it is important to have a network that will support distribution of workloads and easy sharing of data across these mobile devices. Web3 should also take into account advancements in computing such as TPU and quantum processors so its users can take advantage of these invovations. Secure storage and analysis of data is critical for web3's success.  

## What Web3 Realistically Isn't 

Web3 isn't a brand new internet. If you want that, build it, and call it something else. Web3 also isn't something totally different from web2. Web3 is an extension of web2. If you build web3 as something totally different, companies will be less incentivived to adopt it and web3's growth will be highly inhibited.

# Vision
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Web3, in it's current form has many problems. These problems can be solved with proper specifications for web3. These specifications aim to turn web3 into something with high value for buisinesses and consumers without being difficult for developers to implement.

# Philosophy
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

These specifications are built around the following core philosophies that web3 should adopt.

- Secure support for public and private record, resources, and code.
- Implementations should be easy to adopt and easy to swap, both for companies and end users.
- Everything should be purposefully built to solve problems.

# Moto
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Focus on providing great products and/or services to companies and users through web3.

# Problems That Need To Be Solved
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Web3 is not a bad idea from a high level. Block chain, decentralized, and distributed networks are all useful for many tasks. The prolem is that current implementations are hard for companies and consumers to use, lack scale, are poorly specified, lack purpose and vision, etc.

Below, you can find a small list of problems that these specs look to solve.

- web3 is hard to adopt as a business and a consumer
- web3 lacks scalable protocols
- web3 has no proper specification or api
- web3 does not support both public and private resources

A full set of web3 problems that should be fixed is avallible in Problems.md

# Specs
